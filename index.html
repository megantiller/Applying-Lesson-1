  <h4>Smalt</h4>
  <p>Smalt is the lovechild of a forbidden affair between a male Westie and a female Havanese. He was raised by his grandpa and grew up with two brothers, one with a black coat of fur and another with a white coat like his. They spent most of their time playing outside. He is sassy around dogs he knows. He is shy around new people but asks intrusive questions. He learned to read so late that his grandpa was worried he would have to become a <strong>Pooper Scooper.</strong> He is Buddy's ride or die friend and very protective of Kiki. The humans think he is cute while he is grumpy and like <em>get away from me</em>.</p>
